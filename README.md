grunt-cellarise-findatag
==========
This package has been forked from paypal/findatag, and adds a grunt task to generate locale properties from dust templates using an 'i' tag, so that the locale properties file can be automatically generated and used to produce locale property files for other locales.

See the source package for more information - https://www.npmjs.org/package/findatag
